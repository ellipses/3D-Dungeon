Map related stuff


//converting from z and x to row and col
//adjust by scale factor*2, add(because map is in minus) 1 because of origin offset, find mod to get pos
int row = -1*(int)(((float)z_pos/(scale_factor*2)) + 1)%map_height; 
int col = -1*(int)(((float)x_pos/(scale_factor*2)) + 1)%map_width; 

//converting from row and col to z and x_pos/
//multiply by scalefactor times 2, add 1 for offset, multiply by -1
